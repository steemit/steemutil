## Git Operations Rules

- **All git operations must be non-interactive**: Use environment variables, scripts, or command-line flags to avoid interactive prompts
- **No automatic commits**: Never commit changes automatically. Always ask for user confirmation before creating any commit
- **Examples**:
  - Use `GIT_EDITOR`, `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR` environment variables for rebase operations
  - Use `--no-edit` flag for commit amendments when appropriate
  - Use scripts with `sed` or other tools to modify git todo files
  - Never use interactive editors like `vim` or `nano` in git operations
  - Use `git rebase` with prepared scripts instead of interactive mode
  - Always confirm with user before running `git commit` commands

All git operations must be performed non-interactively using scripts, environment variables, or command-line flags.
